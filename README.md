The console app, "Deep Data Killer" is a part of my C++ project "Untrace & Sense Block Storage" Particularly, -

- This app will make data untraceable. Only [shift + del] wont do it for you, but this guided console app will dig deeper and do that for you.
- It will ask you the target drive letter as a single character.
- If the drive is really available, you (user) have access and not write protected, it will give you a final warning message.
- READ THE WARNING CAREFULLY and as you can also exit at that stage if you disagree the warning.
- NOT REQUIRE INTERNET ACCESS.
- NOT CAPABLE OF READING USER's DATA.

    So, enjoy privacy and confidentiality !
